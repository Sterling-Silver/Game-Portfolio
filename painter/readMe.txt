Painter is a game that was created by me and 3 other Florida Polytechnic Students for the Respawn Game Jam of Fall 2021.

Painter was created entirely from scratch.

The engine was made by another person while I created the materials that were used for the designing of the level.
Each material had a different property, like how sand falls and piles.

To run the game follow the path "painter\bin\Debug\painter.exe"
